# Creating the HTML Skeleton

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>your page title goes here</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>

- Keep on hand as `skeleton.html`
- Define a "snippet" in editor that you can insert into your code when needed

## DOCTYPE
- Must be first thing at top of HTML file- not even whitespace can preceed it
- Can be upper or lowercase but only html5 understands lowercase

## `<head>`
- Encloses document header, which consists of elements that provide additional info (metadata) to browser, but does not display
- Common practice to omit indentation for the `<head>` and `<body>` elements and align them both with the `<html>` element
