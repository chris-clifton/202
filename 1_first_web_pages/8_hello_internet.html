  <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I learn <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>
    from a <em>terrific</em> class I'm taking at <a href="https://launchschool.com">Launch School</a>.  
    I'm learning a lot! Why don't you join me?
  </p>

  <p class="more-text">
    There's not a lot of material on this page as I'm playing around with HTML &amp; CSS. When I'm done, these 
    last two paragraphs will take on a lighter color than the first - the "class" attribute on the two 
    &#60;p&#62; tags a bit of CSS will help accomplish that.
  </p>

  <p class="more-text" id="final-paragraph">
    This is the final paragraph is also usee the `class` attribute as an `id` attribute.  We'll use some CSS
      and the `id` attribute to underline the entire paragraph.
