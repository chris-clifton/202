# How to Start Styling a Page
- Start by adding some simple properties, primarily color and font, to the `body` selector to give the page an overall look and feel that focuses on content
- Set the position and size of the organizational components of the page: header, footer, sidebars, etc. to match your desired page structure
- Apply your background and font colors to those parts of the page that need non-default styling

## Step by Step
1. Set background color for page.
2. Set foreground color (text color) to a light gray.
3. Links are hard to read- change them to a different color.  Must apply to the `<a>` tag.
4. Change font with `font-family`
